Author: \[Your Name/Department\]  
Status: Draft

## **1\. Executive Summary**

This document outlines the business requirements for the development of a new, internal Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application. The primary goal of this project is to provide our teams with a simple, intuitive, and efficient tool for managing business contacts and related data.

Current processes may rely on disparate systems or spreadsheets, leading to inefficiencies and potential data inaccuracies. The proposed CRM application will centralize this data, streamline workflows, and improve overall productivity by focusing on core functionalities and an exceptional user experience. The system will be built with a modern technology stack to ensure performance and scalability for our current needs.

## **2\. Business Problem & Opportunity**

### **2.1. Problem Statement**

Our organization currently lacks a centralized and user-friendly system for managing customer and contact information. This results in several challenges:

* **Data Silos:** Information is scattered across various platforms, making it difficult to get a unified view of a contact.  
* **Inefficient Workflows:** Time is lost manually searching for and updating information.  
* **Inconsistent Data:** The risk of data duplication and outdated information is high.  
* **Limited Accessibility:** Accessing and managing data on the go is challenging.

### **2.2. Opportunity**

By developing a streamlined CRM application, we have the opportunity to:

* Increase operational efficiency by automating and simplifying data management tasks.  
* Improve data quality and reliability through a single source of truth.  
* Enhance user productivity by providing a tool that is easy to learn and use.  
* Establish a secure, permissions-based system to ensure data is accessed appropriately.

## **3\. Business Goals & Objectives**

The following are the key business goals for this project, with measurable objectives.

| Goal ID | Goal Statement | Objective(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| BG-01 | Improve User Productivity | \- Reduce time spent on data entry by 20%. \<br\> \- Decrease time to find contact information by 30%. |

## **4\. Functional Requirements**

This section details the specific functionalities required for the application.

### **4.1. List Page Requirements**

To ensure a simple, consistent, and powerful user experience for viewing data across the application, all "List Pages" (e.g., for Contacts, Companies, Deals) must adhere to the following requirements.

| Req. ID | Requirement | Description & Business Rationale | Priority |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **FR-L-01** | **Standardized Layout** | All list pages must share a common visual structure, including the placement of the title, action buttons, filters, and data table. **Rationale:** A consistent layout reduces the cognitive load on users, making the application predictable and faster to learn. | Must-Have |
| **FR-L-02** | **Clear Data Display** | Data must be presented in a clean, readable tabular format. The default view should show a minimal, curated set of the most important columns. **Rationale:** Prevents information overload and allows users to quickly scan for key information. | Must-Have |
| **FR-L-03** | **Global Search Filter** | An always-visible, simple search bar must be provided to allow users to instantly filter all data in the table based on a keyword. **Rationale:** This is the most common filtering action and should be immediately accessible. | Must-Have |
| **FR-L-04** | **Advanced Filtering** | An "Advanced Filter" option must be available to allow users to apply more complex, field-specific filters (e.g., by status, owner). This should be accessible via a button that reveals the options, keeping the primary UI clean. **Rationale:** Provides powerful filtering capabilities without cluttering the interface for users who do not need it. | Should-Have |
| **FR-L-05** | **View Customization** | Users must have the ability to customize their view by: \<br\> 1\. Choosing which columns to show or hide. \<br\> 2\. Resizing the width of columns. **Rationale:** Empowers users to create a workspace tailored to their specific needs, improving their efficiency. | Must-Have |
| **FR-L-06** | **Column Sorting** | Users must be able to sort the data in the table by clicking on any sortable column header. A subsequent click should reverse the sort order. **Rationale:** This is a fundamental requirement for data analysis and organization. | Must-Have |
| **FR-L-07** | **Simple Pagination** | The table must include simple pagination controls (Next, Previous, Page Numbers) and an option for the user to select the number of rows displayed per page (e.g., 10, 25, 50). **Rationale:** Ensures good performance and usability when dealing with datasets larger than a single page. | Must-Have |
| **FR-L-08** | **Quick Record Access** | Clicking on any row in the table must immediately open the detailed view for that specific record in a side drawer, without navigating away from the list page. **Rationale:** Allows for quick context-switching and viewing of details without losing the place in the main list. | Must-Have |
| **FR-L-09** | **Role-Based Column Visibility** | The system must automatically hide certain data columns based on the user's role. Specifically, users with the "Consultant" role must not be able to view any columns containing financial data. **Rationale:** Enforces the principle of least privilege and protects sensitive information. | Must-Have |

### **4.2. Details Page (Drawer & Full Page) Requirements**

To provide a clear and actionable view of individual records, the Details Page must meet the following requirements.

| Req. ID | Requirement | Description & Business Rationale | Priority |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **FR-D-01** | **Quick View Drawer** | The default view for a record's details must be a drawer that slides in from the right side of the screen. **Rationale:** This maintains the user's context within the list page, allowing for rapid viewing of multiple records without losing their place. | Must-Have |
| **FR-D-02** | **Organized Information** | Information within the drawer must be logically grouped into sections (e.g., "Contact Details," "Activity History," "Related Deals"). **Rationale:** An organized layout helps users find specific information quickly and efficiently. | Must-Have |
| **FR-D-03** | **At-a-Glance Summary** | The most critical information (e.g., contact name, company, status) must be displayed prominently at the top of the drawer. **Rationale:** Enables users to identify the record and its key status instantly. | Must-Have |
| **FR-D-04** | **Role-Based Actions** | Actions such as "Edit" and "Delete" must only be visible and/or enabled for users with the appropriate permissions for that specific record. **Rationale:** Ensures data security, integrity, and compliance with business rules. | Must-Have |
| **FR-D-05** | **Full-Page View Option** | The drawer must contain an icon or link to open the record's details in a dedicated, full-page view. **Rationale:** Provides users with an expanded, focused workspace for in-depth review or editing of a single record when needed. | Should-Have |
| **FR-D-06** | **Clear Navigation** | The drawer must be easily dismissible by clicking a close icon, pressing the 'Escape' key, or clicking outside the drawer area. **Rationale:** Ensures intuitive and non-disruptive navigation. | Must-Have |

## **5\. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **5.1. Security & Access Control**

The application must enforce a robust security model to protect data and ensure users only have access to information and functions appropriate for their role.

* **Authentication:** All users must log in with a unique username and password.  
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The system will implement a role-based permission model. The initial roles are defined as follows:  
  * **Admin:** Has unrestricted access to all data and functionality across the entire application. Admins can manage user accounts and system settings.  
  * **Manager:** Can view all data within their assigned team/department, including financial information. Can perform all actions (create, read, update, delete) on records owned by their team.  
  * **Consultant:** Can view and manage records they are assigned to. This role is explicitly **prohibited** from viewing any financial information (e.g., deal values, contract amounts, revenue figures). The system must ensure that all financial data fields and columns are hidden from Consultants throughout the application.
